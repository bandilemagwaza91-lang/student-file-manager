# student-file-manager
📌 Project Overview

This project is a console-based Student Management System built in Python.
It allows users to add, view, search, and delete student records, while ensuring data persistence using file handling.

The system simulates how real-world applications manage data beyond runtime memory and was developed to strengthen foundational programming and system design skills.

🎯 Learning Objectives

This project was created to strengthen understanding of:

Python functions and modular design

Loops and conditionals

File read/write operations

Program flow and logic design

Basic system architecture concepts

⚙️ Features

Add new students (name and age)

View all registered students

Search for a student by name

Delete a student

Automatically save student data to a file

Automatically load saved data when the program starts

🧠 Core Concepts Used

Lists (parallel lists for names and ages)

Functions for modular and reusable logic

while loops for continuous user interaction

File handling (read and write operations)

Input validation

Separation of concerns (logic organized into functions)

📂 File Structure
student-file-manager/
│
├── main.py
├── students.txt
└── README.md

▶️ How to Run

Ensure Python is installed on your system

Clone the repository

Run the program using:

python main.py

📝 Notes

Student data is stored in students.txt

Data persists even after the program is closed

No external libraries are required

🚀 Future Improvements

Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Improved search functionality

Enhanced input validation

Database integration

Multi-user support

Role-based access (admin / user)
